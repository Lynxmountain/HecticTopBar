# HecticTopBar
This is a Module for Roblox Studio which allows the user to easily create a TopBarGUI. This Idea is Based Off of ForeverHD's TopBarPlus Module But it is designed to be more customizable and easier to understand.
If you create a fork of this please Credit me.
This Project is not a copy nor a Fork of ForeverHD's TopBarPlus module, because it uses my own code, but the Idea was gained from them so If you want to, go check out their TopBar Module.

The Code Will be available once version one is finished. Until then, hold on tight.
